            Iâ€™m a PhD student in the <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/statistics">School of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>, advised by <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~mokbel/">Prof. Mohamed F. Mokbel</a>.

            My interests are broadly in database management systems, distributed and cloud systems.
            I'm particularly interested in system architectures for large scale analytics/transaction workloads.
            I also find streaming/real-time data systems interesting.

            My researches at UMN usually use spatial data as showcases.
